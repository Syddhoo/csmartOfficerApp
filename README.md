# csmartOfficerApp
This is my Asp.Net MVC application that I worked on during my internship. I was given to work on the Officer module of the CSAMRT court application.
With this application admin would be able to login using their login credentials that are already stored in the database. They can also search, add, edit or delete officer data and agency data.
I used MVC(Model View Controller) template for this project and Scaffolded (DB first approach) the tables I already created on Microsoft SqlServer and fetched models into my application.
